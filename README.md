# Actuator_Spring_Mass_Model_Controller
This is a controller design and simulation that attempts to control the force of a spring in a spring mass and actuator model.  The overall system consists of two models that are cascaded together.  The first model is a voltage controlled linear actuator and the second is a spring mass system with a mass connected to a fixed object by a spring. The details of the controller design and simulation results can be found in the word document titled Actuator_Spring_Mass_Control_Design.  The simulation can be found in Actuator_Spring_Mass_Control_Design.slx.  The simulation and controller design were created using MATLAB 2018b.  The simulation contains instructions for modifying setpoints and external force on the output.  Actuator_Spring_Mass_controller.m contains all of the system parameters and needs to be in the same MATLAB workspace as Actuator_Spring_Mass_Control_Design.slx to work properly.  The simulation will use the variables created from the script in the simulation
